The Laravel uses the composer to manage your dependencies, so the next step is install Composer.
$curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

Change the permissions to run the composer command without sudo
$sudo chown -R $USER ~/.composer/

Alternatively, you may also init a Laravel project by issuing the Composer create-project command in your terminal:
$composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel project-name

Or install Laravel installer to use the following command “laravel new project”:
$composer global require "laravel/installer"

For the laravel command works we need append a line in bashrc file, if you only uses terminal.
$echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Or append a line in zshrc if you uses ZSH.
$echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.composer/vendor/bin:$PATH"' >>  ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

Restart the terminal. And initialize a Laravel project.
$laravel new blog

Run the Laravel server. Enjoy!
$php artisan serve
